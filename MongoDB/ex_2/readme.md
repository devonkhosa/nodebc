Finished exercise 2.

Selected comics database and queried the superheroes by name as well as image.

db.superheroes.find({"name": "SUPERHERO"})

db.superheroes.find({"image: "superhero.jpg"})

I .gitignored the data folder this time. I felt that pushing it to github was a huge waste, and I kept getting errors that the files were too large. I guess it doesn't make any sense to push a databse onto your repository!
